/*
    JavaScript (JS) is the most popular lightweight, scripting, and interpreted programming language. 
    It was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995. JavaScript is well-known as a scripting language for web pages, 
    mobile apps, web servers, and many other platforms. It is essential for both front-end and back-end developers 
    to have a strong command of JavaScript, as many job roles require fluency in this language.

    1. What are the differences between Java and JavaScript?

        Java is an object Oriented Programming language while 
        JavaScript is a client-side scripting language. Both of them are totally different from each other.

        Java: It is one of the most popular programming languages. 
        It is an object-oriented programming language and has a virtual machine platform that allows you to 
        create compiled programs that run on nearly every platform. Java promised, “Write Once, Run Anywhere”.

        JavaScript: It is a light-weighted programming language (“scripting language”) for developing interactive 
        web pages. It can insert dynamic text into the HTML elements. JavaScript is also known as the browser’s language.

    2. What are Data Types in JavaScript?

        JavaScript data types are categorized into two parts i.e. primitive and non-primitive types.

        Primitive Data Type: The predefined data types provided by JavaScript language are known as primitive data type. 
            Primitive data types are also known as in-built data types.
            Numbers
            Strings
            Boolean
            Symbol
            Undefined
            Null
            BigInt

        Non-Primitive Data Type: The data types that are derived from primitive data types are known as non-primitive data types. 
        It is also known as derived data types or reference data types.
            Objects
            Functions
            Arrays

    3. Which symbol is used for comments in JavaScript? 
    
        Comments prevent the execution of statements. Comments are ignored while the compiler executes the code. 
        
        There are two type of symbols to represent comments in JavaScript:

            a. Double slash: It is known as a single-line comment. 

                            // Single Line Comment

            b. Slash with Asterisk: It is known as a multi-line comment.

                            /* 
                            Multi-line comments
                            ...
                            */

    4. What would be the result of 3+2+”7″?
        Here, 3 and 2 behave like an integer, and “7” behaves like a string. So 3 plus 2 will be 5. 
        Then the output will be 5+”7″ = 57.

    5. What is the use of the isNaN function?
        The number isNan function determines whether the passed value is NaN (Not a number) and is of the type “Number”. 
        In JavaScript, the value NaN is considered a type of number. It returns true if the argument is not a number, 
        else it returns false.

    6. Which is faster in JavaScript and ASP script?
        JavaScript is faster compared to ASP Script. JavaScript is a client-side scripting language and does not 
        depend on the server to execute. 
        The ASP script is a server-side scripting language always dependable on the server.

    7. What is negative infinity?
        The negative infinity is a constant value represents the lowest available value. 
        It means that no other number is lesser than this value. 
        It can be generate using a self-made function or by an arithmetic operation. JavaScript shows 
        the NEGATIVE_INFINITY value as -Infinity.

    8. Is it possible to break JavaScript Code into several lines?
        Yes, it is possible to break the JavaScript code into several lines in a string statement. 
        It can be broken by using the backslash n ‘\n’. 

        For example:
            console.log("A Online Computer Science Portal\n for Geeks")

        The code-breaking line is avoid by JavaScript which is not preferable.
            let gfg= 10, GFG = 5,
            Geeks =
            gfg + GFG;

    9. Which company developed JavaScript?
        Netscape developed JavaScript and was created by Brenden Eich in the year of 1995.

    10. What are undeclared and undefined variables?
        Undefined: It occurs when a variable is declare but not assign any value. Undefined is not a keyword.
        
        Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any variable which is not initialized or declared earlier using 
        the var or const keyword. If we use ‘typeof’ operator to get the value of an undeclare variable, 
        we will face the runtime error with the return value as “undefined”. 
        The scope of the undeclare variables is always global.
